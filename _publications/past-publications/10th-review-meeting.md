The meeting began with an Opening remarks given by Dato Mohamed Sharil Tarmizi on behalf of Chairman of MCMC, followed by reciprocal remarks by Mr. Leong Keng Thai, IDA and Pg Hj Mohd Salleh Pg Hj Aji, AITI.

Amongst the topics discussed are shown below.

The Malaysian Communications & Multimedia Commission hosted the Welcoming dinner at the Pen Mutiara Seafood Restaurant. Amongst the dishes served was its signature dish Fish Head Claypot Curry. Delegates also had the chance to enjoy other Malaysian delicacies including the famous Penang Assam Laksa which was personally recommended by the Chairman himself.

**Communication Above 25GHz Band LEAD BY MCMC**

The high frequency spectrums such as Ka-Band (26.5 to 40 GHz) and E-Band (60 to 90 GHz) offer several advantages over the lower frequencies such as spectrum availability, reduced interference potential and potentially smaller antenna size. However, these advantages come with a cost since high frequencies are more susceptible to tropospheric propagation impairments than lower frequencies.

Current development shows high frequency microwave (10-30GHz) and millimetre wave (30-100GHz) application technology has advanced significantly with the opening up of new frequency bands in these ranges. Applications were developed for such as Local Multipoint Distribution Services (LMDS), point-to-point communication systems, hand-held traffic radars, satellite communications and others.

**Software Defined Radio LEAD BY AITI**

With the rapid development in the radiocommunication services, operators are keen to upgrade or install new services which involve costs in equipment replacement. Software Defined Radio (SDR) provides a radio platform which is adaptable, flexible and may accelerate the introduction of new or revised products and features. Therefore SDR avoids the needs for equipment replacement and only require necessary software upgrade.

In practical, much of the spectrum is unused all the time (or in all locations) despite the fact that it has been assigned e.g. disaster relief and ENG. Cognitive Radio System (CRS) has the capability to adapt its transmission to this unused spectrum and hence offers improvement in the efficient use of the spectrum. Since CRS involves in dynamically adjusting its parameters including the operating frequency, its function can only be realized with the introduction of SDR in a complete cognitive radio system.
