## **8TH FACSMAB Review Meeting**
**The Authority for Info-communications Technology Industry of Brunei Darussalam hosted the 8th FACSMAB Review Meeting on 20th January 2010.**

It was held at the Ulu-ulu Temburong Resort in the Temburong District of Negara Brunei Darussalam. The resort is situated on the banks of Temburong River and Belalong River, in the midst of Temburong National Park Rainforest.

The national park itself is some 50,000 hectares of pristine rainforest with one of the best biodiversity in the world.

The Malaysian delegation was lead by Dato Dr Halim Shafie, Chairman of MCMC and the Singaporean delegation was lead by Mr. Leong Keng Thai, Deputy General of IDA. The meeting was Chaired by Pg Hj Mohd Zain, Chief Executive of AITI.

Amongst the items discussed in the meeting are briefly described below.

**IMT 450- 470MHz LEAD BY MCMC**

As stated in the Radio Regulations (RR) 2008, the following spectrum bands have already been identified by WRC-2007 for IMT:
+ 450-470 MHz; 698/790-806 MHz;
+ 2.3-2.4 GHz and 3 400-3 600 MHz.

The members felt that it would be necessary that the frequency arrangements be harmonized at the border areas to avoid different systems being deployed.

**L-BAND SPECTRUM USAGE AT BORDER AREAS LEAD BY IDA**

ITU Table of allocation has allocated L band (1452MHz to 1492MHz) to be used on sharing basis by Fixed, Mobile, Broadcasting and Broadcasting Satellite services. In most countries, this band is typically used for Digital Sound Broadcast (DSB). This was the outcome from the WARC-92 decision to make allocation to the broadcasting-satellite service (sound) and complementary terrestrial broadcasting service in this band.

Technology based on DAB (Satellite Digital Audio Broadcast or S-DAB and Terrestrial Digital Audio Broadcast or T-DAB) are mostly deployed in this band. In the United State of America however, L band is held by the military for telemetry use.

**UNMANNED AERIAL VEHICLE (UAV) LEAD BY MCMC**

An Unmanned Aerial Vehicle (UAV) is an aircraft that operates without a human pilot onboard. It can either be pre-programmed prior to launch or remote controlled from a control station via a communication link. The link types can vary related to the operation and the autonomy used by the UAV. There is a wide variety of functions that a UAV can perform which can be classified in three categories, commercial, civil use for the general protection of the public and for security purposes.

**INTELLIGENT TRANSPORT SYSTEM IN 5.9GHz BAND LEAD BY IDA**

Intelligent Transportation Systems (ITS) is a range of diverse technologies designed primarily to improve road safety, ease traffic congestion and reduction in pollution. The intelligent aspect of this technology leverages on the existing Wifi standard (i.e. IEEE 802.11) in enabling cars to automatically communicate with each other, make emergency calls in the case of a collision, or even apply the brakes. This new technology overcomes the current limitation of peer-to-peer real-time communication between moving vehicles; the main applications of ITS in place today only allow the monitoring of traffic flows and transmitting such information from a fixed location to the motoring public.

**ELECTRONIC NEWS GATHERING (ENG) LEAD BY AITI**

Electronic News Gathering (ENG) is an agenda item (A.I 1.5) to be debated for WRC-2011. It calls for a worldwide/regional harmonization use of spectrum in accordance to Resolution 954[COM6/5] (WRC-07). In the past, there have been many options for ENG use worldwide. However, over the years and of late, these bands have been either fully utilized or allocated to mobile services on an exclusive basis. Radio microphones, handheld video electronic cameras with radio links are an important part of ENG. They are becoming ubiquitous equipment used in services ancillary to programme-making and to broadcasting. In achieving the necessary audio performance for professional use, the transmitted signal requires a channel bandwidth of up to 200 kHz.

**AMATEUR RADIO INI THE 5MHz BAND (SECONDARY) LEAD BY AITI**

Radio amateurs use various modes of transmission to communicate. Voice transmissions are the most common, with some utilizing frequency modulation (FM) offering high quality audio and others such as single sideband (SSB) offering more reliable communications when signals are marginal and bandwidth is restricted.

The International Telecommunication Union (ITU) governs the allocation of frequency worldwide with national communication regulators have some liberty to restrict access to these frequencies or to allocate additional allocation as long as radio services in neighboring or other countries do not experience any interference.
